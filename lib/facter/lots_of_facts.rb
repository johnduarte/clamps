# To compensate for our non-root user agents having virtually no facts, and to
# exercise the parts of the stack which need to handle changing fact data (e.g.,
# puppetdb), we generate facts and provide changing fact values over the course
# of multiple runs here.
#
# We allow the CLAMPS configuration to dictate how many facts are generated, and
# what percentage of facts should change over each run.
#
# In earlier implementations, fact randomization generated long random values
# for every fact, with every value changing on every run. This meant 100% fact
# churn, which ends up trashing the puppetdb cache (which ends up doing bad
# things to puppetdb).
#
# Since the goal of CLAMPS is to provide load sufficient to exercise a puppet
# deployment, and to give confidence that if the running system falls over that
# it was not due to the artificial nature of testing, this prior approach was
# undesirable.
#
# Here there are a few things happening:
#
# We extracted a set of real-world fact names from an agent running on an EC2
# node. We saved the lengths of the fact values. This allows us to generate
# facts and values with at least the length distributions we could expect to see
# in the real world.
#
# We generate a list of CLAMPS fact names that will be persistent across runs.
# For a given number of facts per agent (`#number_of_facts`, below), the same
# list of fact names will always be generated. These will be in the form
# clamps_factname_index (e.g., "clamps_uptime_3"). This also implies a
# consistency across agents running independently -- i.e., if two agents are
# requested to have 100 facts, they will be the same 100 named facts on each
# agent.
#
# Based upon configuration (`#percent_to_change` below), we choose a certain
# number of facts to receive random values each run. The names of the facts
# which get random values will be consistent between runs, and all other facts
# always have the same values. This will also actually be consistent between
# agents as well, provided the `#number_of_facts` and `#percent_to_change`
# values are set identically.
#
# By choosing a fixed set of random fact names to change we avoid variation in
# churn. The alternative is that if a random, say, 10% of facts are given random
# values, we are either forced to save old fact values between runs to avoid
# changing them (which introduces unwanted storage and serialization headaches),
# or we end up changing old "randomized" values back to some known fixed value
# while we randomize other fact values (which results in an inconsistent amount
# of change between runs).
#
# Our techniques here should also better simulate real-world behavior, where
# many facts never change over the lifetime of a node, and certain specific
# facts are known to change regularly, across most nodes.
